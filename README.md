# Book Club Landing Page

## Overview

This is a simple landing page designed to promote a book club and encourage visitors to sign up and join their literary community.

I completed this project for an assignment in [The Odin Project Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).
